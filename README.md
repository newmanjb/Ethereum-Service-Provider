# Ethereum-Service-Provider
Truffle project containing smart contracts written in solidity that allow users to subscribe to either a one-day free trial or a paid longer-term subscription to a particular service, which is configurable. The contracts are fully covered by unit tests (also written in solidity) that use a film rental service as an example.

@todo - ServiceProvider could manage > 1 service and allow each user to subscribe to >1.
