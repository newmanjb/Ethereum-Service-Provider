# Ethereum-Service-Provider
Truffle project containing smart contracts written in solidity that allow users to subscribe to either a one-day free trial or a paid longer-term subscription to one or more service e.g. a movie streaming service or an e-book service.  The contracts are covered by unit tests (also written in solidity).
