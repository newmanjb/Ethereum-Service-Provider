# Ethereum-Service-Provider
Truffle project containing a smart contract written in solidity that allows users to subscribe to a one-day trial for any service (a film rental service in this example).  The contract includes a unit test (also written in solidity).

@todo - provide a list of services that can be subscribed to, not just one
@todo - add an option for proper subscriptions that involves money transfer every month
